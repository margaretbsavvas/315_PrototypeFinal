# 315_PrototypeFinal
*****************
_**INTERATION 1**_
*****************
Hypothesis: Previously I had the player able to move the camera movements while using 1st person and kept 3rd person's camera movement static. I wanted to reverse this and have the 3rd person camera movement movable and keep 1st person camera's movement satic. I wanted to see if players would still utilize the two different perspectives.
----
All five players preferred to use the 3rd person movement because it allowed for camera movement. Playtester 6 expressed that it was "more comfortable to see where you are going". However, I want to keep the level challenging by limiting the players perspectives. Although players prefer to use the 3rd person view with the adjustable camera, it makes the level too easy to navigate through. Barely any of the players used the 1st person because it was static, even when they were entering the tunnels in level 4 (from prototype 4). 
Since I used a milkway skybox for all scenes in this prototype, playtester 3 expressed that they would have liked to have seen some use of gravity that could potentionally play into the narrative of the using the milkyway skybox. They also said it would be nice if each level had a different atmosphere, as if the player were to be on a different planet. Playtester 4 mentioned something similar but different. They stated that level 1 did not feel cohesive with the rest of the level due to the vegetation only appearing once. For the next interation I would like to take this into accout and find a good balance between the two feedbacks given. 
I also realized that the controls are not intuitive, as well as the image instructions, and should add an opening scene as a start menu with simple game controls and indication that images are meant to be deciphered to have a better sense of how to navigate the puzzle. 
I did take into consideration bugs from prototype 3 and prototype 4 when meshing the two for my final prototype. For example in prototype 3, each level was in a box but the outer walls did not have collisions and it was not a clear fix. When adding _convex_ to the shapes in pro builder, it then made it impossible for a player to fall vertically through the ground. In order to fix this issues, I removed the boxed and just added cubes that I formed into walls. I then seperated all three levels of prototype 3 into three seperate scenes and had prototype 4 has a fourth scene. I used the BuildSettings in Unity and a simple line of code from the SceneManagement libary to make LevelExits. The LevelExits are simply just cubes without shapes that have a collider which will transfer the player into the next level. 
There are a few minor bugs that will have to be addressed for the next interation. These bugs include the LevelExit in level 3, where the player jumps to level 4 before being able to jump vertically at the end of the level. Another is the player controller in level 2 where the jump is not enabled and the speed of the player is slowed down drastically, many playetesters were frustated and impatient with this. I also need to remove the friction on objects because often players find themselves stuck to an object being falling, this really sucks in level 3 when trying to dodge the moving objects and in level 4 when navigating up the stairs. 
I also will need to add a respawn for when players fall off edges, and add collisions to the moving objects in level 3. I would also ensure that he moving objects in level 3 actually kill a player a force them to respawn at the end of the level. I would like the player to die in someway in each level because I feel like it would add some sort difficulty and/or more challange to the game rather than a simple obstacle course.

_**INTERATION 2**_
*****************
Hypothesis: If I add a way (or more) to die in each level, will this make the level more challenging? Will the player become frustrated? Does removing the photo instrucitons make it more challenging to figure out? 
----
All 10 playtesters had similar reactions this time. All playetesters found the levels slightly more challenging and much more engaging now that there is a way to die and respawn at the beginning of each level. In level 1, I added a terrain to show a nice landscape, however, if you jump off the initial platform you die. A few playtesters were not even sure if they should jump down the exit hole because they though that might die. In level 2, for the maze, I added ruin that are glowing pink. These ruins teleport the player back to the beginning of the maze. Many of the playtesters thought that they had to find a "different" ruin, but they are all the same. Some playtesters were confused as to how to get out of the maze since all the "portal" bring you back to the beginning. In level 3, I did not change anything other making sure that the moving blocks kill the player and forces them to restart the level. In level 4, I added deadly mushrooms that must be avoided else they also bring you back to the beginning of the level. With all these new addition, I found that players were not too frustrated. If anything it encouraged them to try different routes, methods, and even forced players to utilize the different perspectives.  
I also decided to remove the photo instructions in order to see if the levels were intuitive or if they just became more complicated because the goal is no longer clear. I found that the players eventually figure out what they need to do. The only thing that needs to be clearer are the exits to complete the levels. Many were suspicious about certain level exits because other objects in the scene (like the maxe level) deceived them into failure. 
There were many playtesters who commented on the environment itself and how it helped with the theme of discovering as you go. There were many comments about the music of each level and how the different tracks helped brig the player into different "spaces". 
I did find that majority of players forgot their controls or to utilize "v" to change perspectives. For the final, I will maybe have to add a simple instructions cheat sheet in the corner of the player's UI.
I also realized that I was using box collider to prevent players from going through objects, but I should be using a mesh collider. For example, with the trees, using a box collider is a bit weird because the player can still jump through the leaves but not the trunk.

_**INTERATION 2**_
*****************
NOTE: For this interation, because I was feeling unwell and could not attend class, I had a few friends playtest this interaton. I first had them play the previous iteration (re-saved a copy to my desktop from my previous push to github) and then had them play the newest iteration so that they could properly give me feedback based on my hypothesis. 
---
Hypothesis: If I switch the dodging level (originally 3) to level 2, and the maze (originally 2) to level 3, will the flow of difficulty feel more progressive to the player? 
---
After switching the levels and having people play test the old one vs the new one, many playtesters said that it felt more progressive. Although the maze is simple, because of the lighting and the pattern of the walls, it's very easy to get disoriented. I also added ruins, which once a player collides with, they respawn at the begin. There are a few of these through the maze and they are meant to trick the player into thinking they can teleport closer to the level exit. I found that players tend to be stuck on the maze level just as long as the last level. The level with the dodging cubes seemed to be easier for players to get through. I originally had a lot of tunnels and barriers to jump over. However, players found this very repetitive since in the last level, you are essentially jumping barriers and navigating through tunnels. In the end, level 2 ended up just being a dodging objects levels. 
Level 4 is hard because I of the various deadly mushrooms. The last stretch of the map was almost impossible to get through because i made the obstacles to high to jump on, and the msuhrooms blocked any passage to get by. I rearranged it and had players redo this area to ensure that it was actually beatable. 
I also noticed that a lot of players didn't initially know where to go in order to progess to the next level. In level 1, the exploration level, many players found the hole in the ground but decided to not go down it because they associated falling off with dying and respawning. In order to tell the player tha they should maybe enter it, without directly writing or explaining it, I added a yellow light. The yellow light is meant to mimic the glow of gold, thus telling the player that this is the way towards the gold. I also fixed many colliders in level 1. Beforehand I was using box collider on the tree and bridges, however it made navigating through the map very annoying as you could hit a tree when you think you haven't. I simply switched the box collider to mesh colliders.
The biggest thing I have noticed with players is that they always forget to utilized both camera views (1st person and 3rd person). Although it is the first listed in the instructions, players STILL don't use it. I was considering having the "press V to switch views" swritten on the player's UI. However, I found that it made it too easy for players to get through the levels because they were constantly reminded of it.
